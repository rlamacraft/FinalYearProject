\title{What is Material Design?}

\paragraph{Material Design is a design language developed in 2014 by Google. Expanding upon the "card" motifs that debuted in Google Now, Material Design makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.}

\itemize{
  Material is the metaphor.
  Bold, graphic, intentional.
  Motion provides meaning.
